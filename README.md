# google-trans-imports
Python - Basic translation utility for discord

Must: 

repl.it shell: `pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0`

Info:

The libs.py file is there to distinguish itself from the translate.py file. In the actual code, do not seperate these files. Add everything in libs.py under your "import discord" and "from discord.ext import commands" lines of your main.py. Then import everything in the translate.py file into your main.py file.
